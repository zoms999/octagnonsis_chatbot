# WebSocket Connection Stability Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the WebSocket connection system to address stability issues and prevent connection loops as specified in requirements 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Connection Loop Prevention

**Problem**: Multiple simultaneous connection attempts could cause infinite loops and resource exhaustion.

**Solution**: 
- Added `isConnecting` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous connection attempts
- Added `connectionId` tracking to ignore events from stale connections
- Added rate limiting for connection attempts (2-second minimum between attempts)
- Added connection timeout handling (10-second timeout)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Prevent connection loops
if (this.isConnecting || this.ws?.readyState === WebSocket.CONNECTING || this.ws?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  console.log('WebSocket already connecting or connected, skipping connection attempt');
  return;
}

// Set connecting flag and increment connection ID
this.isConnecting = true;
this.connectionId++;
const currentConnectionId = this.connectionId;
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

**Problem**: Poor error handling led to unexpected disconnections and failed reconnection attempts.

**Solution**:
- Added specific handling for different WebSocket close codes
- Implemented smart reconnection logic that respects close codes
- Added proper error messages for different failure scenarios
- Added connection timeout detection and handling

**Implementation**:
```typescript
private shouldAttemptReconnect(closeCode: number): boolean {
  // Don't reconnect for certain close codes
  const noReconnectCodes = [
    1000, // Normal closure
    1001, // Going away
    4000, // Authentication failed
    4001, // Unauthorized
    4003, // Forbidden
  ];
  return !noReconnectCodes.includes(closeCode);
}

private getCloseErrorMessage(closeCode: number): string {
  switch (closeCode) {
    case 1006: return 'Connection lost unexpectedly';
    case 1011: return 'Server error occurred';
    case 4000: return 'Authentication failed';
    case 4001: return 'Unauthorized access';
    default: return 'Connection error';
  }
}
```

### 3. Manual Disconnection Tracking

**Problem**: Auto-reconnection would trigger even after manual disconnections.

**Solution**:
- Added `isManuallyDisconnected` flag to track intentional disconnections
- Prevent auto-reconnection when manually disconnected
- Clear manual flag only on explicit reconnection or reset

**Implementation**:
```typescript
disconnect(): void {
  console.log('Manually disconnecting WebSocket');
  this.isManuallyDisconnected = true;
  // ... rest of disconnect logic
}

// In handleClose - don't reconnect if manually disconnected
if (this.isManuallyDisconnected || event.code === 1000) {
  this.updateState({ status: 'disconnected', reconnectAttempts: this.reconnectAttempts });
  return;
}
```

### 4. Connection State Management

**Problem**: Stale event handlers could cause state corruption and unexpected behavior.

**Solution**:
- Added connection ID tracking to ignore events from old connections
- Enhanced event handler binding with connection ID validation
- Added proper cleanup of timers and state on disconnect

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Bind event handlers with connection ID
this.ws.onopen = (event) => this.handleOpen(event, currentConnectionId);
this.ws.onmessage = (event) => this.handleMessage(event, currentConnectionId);
this.ws.onclose = (event) => this.handleClose(event, currentConnectionId);
this.ws.onerror = (event) => this.handleError(event, currentConnectionId);

// In event handlers - ignore events from old connections
private handleOpen(event: Event, connectionId: number): void {
  if (connectionId !== this.connectionId) {
    console.log(`Ignoring open event from old connection #${connectionId}`);
    return;
  }
  // ... handle event
}
```

### 5. Hook-Level Improvements

**Problem**: React hooks could trigger infinite re-renders and connection loops.

**Solution**:
- Added connection attempt throttling in `useWebSocket` hook
- Enhanced dependency management to prevent unnecessary re-connections
- Added proper cleanup and error handling in subscription hooks
- Added connection health monitoring

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Prevent rapid connection attempts
const now = Date.now();
if (connectionAttemptRef.current || (now - lastConnectTimeRef.current) < 2000) {
  console.log('Connection attempt already in progress or too recent, skipping');
  return;
}

// Enhanced auto-connect logic with max attempts check
if (user?.id && (state.status === 'disconnected' || state.status === 'error')) {
  if (state.reconnectAttempts < 5) {
    console.log('Auto-connecting WebSocket for user:', user.id);
    const cleanup = connect();
    return () => cleanup?.then(fn => fn?.());
  } else {
    console.log('Max reconnect attempts reached, not auto-connecting');
  }
}
```

### 6. Health Monitoring

**Problem**: No way to determine if WebSocket connection was actually healthy.

**Solution**:
- Added `isHealthy()` method to check connection state
- Added `reset()` method to force clean reconnection
- Added proper state reporting in hooks

**Implementation**:
```typescript
isHealthy(): boolean {
  return this.ws?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN && !this.isConnecting;
}

reset(): void {
  console.log('Resetting WebSocket client state');
  this.disconnect();
  this.reconnectAttempts = 0;
  this.isConnecting = false;
  this.isManuallyDisconnected = false;
  this.connectionId++;
  this.messageQueue = [];
}
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify the improvements:

1. **Connection Loop Prevention Tests**: Verify multiple connection attempts are properly handled
2. **Error Handling Tests**: Test different close codes and error scenarios
3. **State Management Tests**: Verify proper state tracking and cleanup
4. **Health Monitoring Tests**: Test connection health reporting
5. **Manual Verification Tests**: Validate all new methods and properties exist

## Requirements Addressed

- **4.1**: ✅ Updated WebSocket connection logic to prevent connection loops
- **4.2**: ✅ Added proper error handling for connection failures  
- **4.4**: ✅ Enhanced connection stability with timeout handling and smart reconnection

## Benefits

1. **Stability**: Eliminates connection loops and reduces connection failures
2. **Performance**: Prevents resource exhaustion from multiple connection attempts
3. **User Experience**: Provides better error messages and more reliable connections
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner state management and better debugging capabilities
5. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases and network issues more gracefully

## Files Modified

- `front/src/lib/websocket.ts` - Core WebSocket client improvements
- `front/src/hooks/websocket-hooks.ts` - Hook-level stability improvements
- `front/src/hooks/__tests__/websocket-stability-manual.test.tsx` - Test coverage

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. Existing code will continue to work without modifications, but will benefit from the improved stability and error handling.
