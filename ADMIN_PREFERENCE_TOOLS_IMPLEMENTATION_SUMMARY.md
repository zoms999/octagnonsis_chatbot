- System-wide preference data health overview
- Shows coverage statistics and health assessment

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Diagnose a specific user
python admin_preference_cli.py diagnose 12345 --verbose

# Test queries with sample data
python admin_preference_cli.py test 12345 --include-sample

# Repair user data
python admin_preference_cli.py repair 12345

# Bulk analysis
python admin_preference_cli.py bulk-diagnose 10000 15000 --only-issues

# System overview
python admin_preference_cli.py overview
```

### 4. Enhanced Repository Methods (`database/repositories.py`)

**New Methods Added**:
- `get_unique_anp_seqs()`: Get list of unique user sequence numbers
- `get_total_user_count()`: Get total count of unique users
- `get_users_with_document_type()`: Get users with specific document types
- `delete_document()`: Delete documents by ID with cache invalidation

### 5. Enhanced Validator Methods (`etl/preference_data_validator.py`)

**New Method Added**:
- `validate_user_preference_data()`: Comprehensive validation for all preference data types for a specific user

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_admin_preference_tools.py`)

**Test Coverage**:
