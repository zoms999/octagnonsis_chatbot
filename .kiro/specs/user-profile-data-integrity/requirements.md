# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical data integrity issues in the aptitude analysis chatbot system where user profile information is inconsistently stored and retrieved, leading to AI hallucination and incorrect user data presentation. The current system has mismatched data between the legacy database (mwd_* tables) and the chat system (chat_users table), causing the AI to provide inaccurate or fabricated responses about user demographics and profile information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to accurately retrieve and display my demographic information (age, gender, name), so that the AI chatbot provides correct information about my profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about their age and gender THEN the system SHALL retrieve accurate data from the mwd_person table via the user's anp_seq
2. WHEN user demographic data exists THEN the system SHALL return the correct age calculated from birth date and gender information
3. WHEN user demographic data is missing THEN the system SHALL explicitly state that the information is not available rather than hallucinating
4. IF the user's anp_seq cannot be found THEN the system SHALL log the error and inform the user that profile data is unavailable
5. WHEN displaying user information THEN the system SHALL use the real name from mwd_person.pe_name instead of generated usernames

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent user identification across legacy and chat systems, so that user data can be accurately linked and retrieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an aptitude test THEN the system SHALL store the anp_seq as the primary identifier in chat_users table
2. WHEN creating chat_users records THEN the system SHALL populate the name field with the actual user name from mwd_person table
3. WHEN storing user email THEN the system SHALL retrieve and store the actual email address instead of leaving it NULL
4. IF user data synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and attempt retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN querying user profiles THEN the system SHALL use anp_seq to join between chat_users and mwd_person tables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI chatbot to provide accurate responses based on my actual test data, so that I receive reliable information about my aptitude results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates responses about user demographics THEN it SHALL only use verified data from the database
2. WHEN user data is incomplete or missing THEN the AI SHALL acknowledge the limitation instead of generating fictional information
3. WHEN providing user profile information THEN the system SHALL validate data accuracy before including it in AI responses
4. IF demographic queries return no results THEN the AI SHALL respond with "I don't have access to that information" rather than making assumptions
5. WHEN user data exists but is incomplete THEN the AI SHALL specify which information is available and which is missing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust data validation and error handling for user profile queries, so that the system gracefully handles data inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing user profile queries THEN the system SHALL validate that anp_seq exists and is properly formatted
2. WHEN joining tables for user data THEN the system SHALL handle cases where relationships are broken or missing
3. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the specific anp_seq and query
4. IF database connections fail during profile queries THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate timeout and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN user data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache it temporarily to avoid repeated database calls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of user profile data issues, so that I can identify and resolve data integrity problems proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user profile queries fail THEN the system SHALL log the anp_seq, error type, and attempted query
2. WHEN data mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL create alerts for administrative review
3. WHEN users report incorrect information THEN the system SHALL provide audit trails showing data sources and transformations
4. IF systematic data issues are detected THEN the system SHALL generate reports highlighting affected users and data types
5. WHEN profile data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain change logs with timestamps and source information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my educational and professional background information to be accurately displayed, so that career recommendations are based on correct data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying educational background THEN the system SHALL show correct school name, graduation year, and major from mwd_person table
2. WHEN showing professional information THEN the system SHALL display accurate job status, company name, and job title
3. WHEN education or job data is missing THEN the system SHALL indicate which specific fields are unavailable
4. IF professional status codes need translation THEN the system SHALL properly join with mwd_common_code table for readable descriptions
5. WHEN career recommendations are generated THEN they SHALL be based on verified educational and professional background data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified user profile service that consolidates data from multiple sources, so that all parts of the application have consistent access to user information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs user profile data THEN it SHALL use a centralized UserProfileService
2. WHEN the service retrieves user data THEN it SHALL combine information from mwd_person, mwd_account, and chat_users tables
3. WHEN profile data is requested THEN the service SHALL return a standardized UserProfile object with all available information
4. IF data retrieval fails THEN the service SHALL provide detailed error information and fallback options
5. WHEN profile data changes THEN the service SHALL invalidate relevant caches and update dependent systems
