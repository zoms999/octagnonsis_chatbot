# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing an interactive web application frontend for an AI aptitude analysis chatbot. The application will be built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, integrating with an existing FastAPI backend to provide user authentication, real-time chat functionality with WebSocket support, conversation history management, ETL processing status monitoring, and comprehensive user management features.

## Requirements

4. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect user to /chat page and maintain authentication state
5. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with field-specific validation feedback
6. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify existing tokens using GET /api/auth/me and auto-logout if invalid
7. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored tokens and redirect to login page

### Requirement 2: Real-time Chat Interface

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to ask questions about my aptitude analysis through a chat interface and receive real-time responses, so that I can get immediate insights about my career aptitude.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters the chat page THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connection to /api/chat/ws/{user_id}
2. WHEN a user types a question THEN the system SHALL validate input and send via WebSocket with rate limiting protection
3. WHEN a question is processing THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and processing status updates
4. WHEN a response is received THEN the system SHALL display the answer with confidence score, processing time, and retrieved document count
5. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to HTTP POST /api/chat/question automatically
6. WHEN rate limit is exceeded (429) THEN the system SHALL disable input temporarily and show user-friendly waiting message
7. WHEN user has no documents THEN the system SHALL display helpful guidance message instead of error

### Requirement 3: Chat Response Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the source documents and confidence metrics for each chat response, so that I can understand the basis of the AI's recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat response is displayed THEN the system SHALL show retrieved documents summary in a side panel
2. WHEN a response includes confidence score THEN the system SHALL display it as a visual indicator (progress bar or badge)
3. WHEN a response includes processing time THEN the system SHALL show this metric to the user
4. WHEN a user wants to provide feedback THEN the system SHALL display feedback buttons (helpful/rating/comments)
5. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL call POST /api/chat/feedback and show confirmation

### Requirement 4: Conversation History Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my previous conversations and their details, so that I can reference past aptitude analysis discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the history page THEN the system SHALL display paginated conversation list using GET /api/chat/history/{user_id}
2. WHEN a user clicks on a conversation item THEN the system SHALL open detailed view in a modal
3. WHEN pagination is needed THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls with limit/offset parameters
4. WHEN loading history THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and handle empty states gracefully

### Requirement 5: ETL Processing Status Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the status of my aptitude test data processing, so that I know when my documents are ready for chat queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the ETL page THEN the system SHALL display job history using GET /api/etl/users/{user_id}/jobs
2. WHEN a user selects a specific job THEN the system SHALL show detailed status using GET /api/etl/jobs/{job_id}/status
3. WHEN a job is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress using SSE from GET /api/etl/jobs/{job_id}/progress
4. WHEN a job can be retried or cancelled THEN the system SHALL provide action buttons calling POST /api/etl/jobs/{job_id}/retry or cancel
5. WHEN a user triggers reprocessing THEN the system SHALL call POST /api/etl/users/{user_id}/reprocess with appropriate confirmation

### Requirement 6: User Profile and Document Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my profile information and manage my documents, so that I can understand my account status and available data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the profile page THEN the system SHALL display profile summary using GET /api/users/{user_id}/profile
2. WHEN profile is loaded THEN the system SHALL show document count, conversation count, available document types, and last conversation time
3. WHEN a user visits documents page THEN the system SHALL display document list with type filtering using GET /api/users/{user_id}/documents
4. WHEN documents are displayed THEN the system SHALL show content previews based on document type (primary_tendency, top_skills, top_jobs)
5. WHEN a user wants to reprocess documents THEN the system SHALL provide reprocess trigger with appropriate confirmations

### Requirement 7: Secure Token Management

**User Story:** As a system, I want to securely manage JWT tokens and handle authentication failures gracefully, so that user data remains protected and the user experience is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing tokens THEN the system SHALL prioritize httpOnly cookies or secure memory storage over localStorage
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL automatically attach Bearer tokens to Authorization headers
3. WHEN receiving 401 responses THEN the system SHALL automatically logout user and redirect to login
4. WHEN tokens are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL clear stored tokens and require re-authentication
5. WHEN admin features are accessed THEN the system SHALL include X-Admin-Token header if configured

### Requirement 8: Responsive UI/UX Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean, responsive interface that works well on different devices and provides good accessibility, so that I can use the application comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a 3-column layout (navigation, main content, document panel) using Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt layout to single column with collapsible panels
3. WHEN displaying chat messages THEN the system SHALL use appropriate chat bubble styling with clear sender identification
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and skeleton screens
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly toast notifications
6. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper aria-labels and focus management

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Resilience
