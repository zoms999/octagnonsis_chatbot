# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical frontend issues preventing the AI aptitude chatbot application from functioning properly. The system currently experiences main page loading failures and infinite loop issues during chat interactions, making the application unusable for end users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main page to load successfully without chunk loading errors, so that I can access the application interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the main page THEN the system SHALL load all required JavaScript chunks without timeout errors
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display the main interface within 3 seconds
3. IF chunk loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback loading mechanism or retry logic
4. WHEN the Next.js configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use only supported configuration options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to engage in chat conversations without infinite loops, so that I can receive meaningful responses about my aptitude test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL process and respond exactly once
2. WHEN the chat system receives a response THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger additional automatic requests
3. IF a WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without infinite retry loops
4. WHEN chat state updates occur THEN the system SHALL prevent recursive state changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Next.js configuration to be compatible with the current version, so that the application builds and runs without warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT display configuration warnings about deprecated options
2. WHEN using Next.js 14+ THEN the system SHALL use App Router without experimental flags
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without configuration errors
4. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN the system SHALL load them correctly in both client and server contexts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable WebSocket connections for real-time chat, so that my conversations are responsive and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing a WebSocket connection THEN the system SHALL connect successfully to the backend
2. WHEN the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN receiving messages THEN the system SHALL update the UI without causing re-renders that trigger new connections
4. IF the WebSocket server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and potentially recover.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN chunk loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry options or alternative loading methods
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error states without breaking the interface
4. WHEN the application encounters unrecoverable errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for resolution
