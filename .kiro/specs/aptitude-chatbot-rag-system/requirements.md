# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of an existing aptitude test chatbot system from a static 37-table structure to an intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The current system generates static reports using 37 predefined SQL queries, but lacks the flexibility for dynamic conversational interactions. The new system will process test results into semantic documents optimized for vector search and LLM-powered conversations, enabling users to have natural dialogues about their aptitude test results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test administrator, I want the system to automatically process completed aptitude tests into semantic documents, so that users can have intelligent conversations about their results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an aptitude test THEN the system SHALL execute all 37 existing SQL queries to extract raw test data
2. WHEN raw test data is extracted THEN the system SHALL transform the data into thematic documents (personality profile, thinking skills, career recommendations, etc.)
3. WHEN documents are created THEN the system SHALL generate embedding vectors using Google Gemini and store them in the chat_documents table
4. IF the data processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify administrators
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL make the user's data available for chatbot interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask natural language questions about my aptitude test results, so that I can understand my personality, skills, and career recommendations in an interactive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about their results THEN the system SHALL convert the question to an embedding vector
2. WHEN the question vector is created THEN the system SHALL search for semantically similar documents using pgvector similarity search
3. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL retrieve the top matching documents for the user
4. IF no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the question cannot be answered based on their test results
5. WHEN documents are retrieved THEN the system SHALL use them as context for LLM response generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to provide comprehensive and contextual answers about my test results, so that I can gain deeper insights into my aptitude profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system has retrieved relevant documents THEN it SHALL construct a prompt combining the user question and document context
2. WHEN the prompt is ready THEN the system SHALL send it to Google Gemini LLM for response generation
3. WHEN the LLM generates a response THEN the system SHALL return it to the user through the chat interface
4. IF the LLM response is incomplete or unclear THEN the system SHALL allow follow-up questions
5. WHEN providing career recommendations THEN the system SHALL include specific reasoning based on the user's personality and skill profiles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from the current 37-table structure to an optimized RAG database schema, so that the system can efficiently handle vector searches and document storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new schema THEN the system SHALL create tables with chat_ prefix following the established naming convention
2. WHEN creating the chat_documents table THEN it SHALL include fields for user_id, doc_type, content (JSON), summary_text, and embedding_vector
3. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL support different document types (PERSONALITY_PROFILE, THINKING_SKILLS, CAREER_RECOMMENDATIONS, etc.)
4. IF vector operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use pgvector extension for efficient similarity searches
5. WHEN the new schema is ready THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and support concurrent user access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reuse the existing 37 SQL queries as part of the ETL pipeline, so that we can leverage the existing business logic while improving the system architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the ETL pipeline THEN the system SHALL integrate the existing AptitudeTestQueries class
2. WHEN processing test results THEN the system SHALL execute all 37 queries and collect results in a structured format
3. WHEN transforming data THEN the system SHALL create meaningful document combinations from query results
4. IF query execution fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue processing other queries
5. WHEN data transformation is complete THEN the system SHALL validate document structure before storage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to understand the relationships between different aspects of my test results, so that I can get holistic insights about my aptitude profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documents THEN the system SHALL preserve relationships between personality traits, thinking skills, and career recommendations
2. WHEN a user asks about career fit THEN the system SHALL reference both personality and skill data to provide comprehensive explanations
3. WHEN discussing strengths and weaknesses THEN the system SHALL provide context from multiple assessment dimensions
4. IF a user asks about learning styles THEN the system SHALL connect personality traits with recommended study methods
5. WHEN providing statistical comparisons THEN the system SHALL include percentile rankings and peer group data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast and responsive chatbot interactions, so that I can have smooth conversations about my test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN performing vector searches THEN the system SHALL return results within 500 milliseconds
3. WHEN the system is under high load THEN it SHALL maintain response times under 10 seconds
4. IF response time exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback about processing status
5. WHEN caching is possible THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed documents to improve performance
