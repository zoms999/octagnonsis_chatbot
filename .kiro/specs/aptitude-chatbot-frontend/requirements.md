# Requirements Document

## Introduction

적성검사 기반 지능형 챗봇의 Next.js 프론트엔드 애플리케이션을 구현합니다. 이 시스템은 사용자가 로그인하여 적성검사 결과에 대해 AI 챗봇과 대화하고, 테스트 결과를 조회할 수 있는 웹 애플리케이션입니다. 백엔드 Python API와 연동하여 인증, 채팅, ETL 처리 기능을 제공합니다.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses the test results tab THEN the system SHALL display list of completed tests with status
2. WHEN user selects a test result THEN the system SHALL show detailed test information and scores
3. WHEN test processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress updates via SSE
4. WHEN user wants to reprocess data THEN the system SHALL provide reprocess option with confirmation
5. IF no test results exist THEN the system SHALL show empty state with guidance to take tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between chat and test tabs seamlessly, so that I can efficiently access different features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is on any page THEN the system SHALL display clear navigation tabs for Chat and Tests
2. WHEN user switches tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of the previous tab
3. WHEN user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain the current tab selection
4. WHEN user accesses a direct URL THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate tab
5. IF user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login regardless of requested tab
