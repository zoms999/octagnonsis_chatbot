# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the missing PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS document type in the aptitude analysis chatbot system. Currently, users receive the message "이미지 선호도 분석 데이터가 아직 준비되지 않았습니다" when asking about preference-related topics, indicating that the ETL pipeline is not properly generating PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS documents from the available legacy database queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive accurate preference analysis results from my aptitude test, so that I can understand my image preferences and related career recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ETL pipeline processes my test results THEN it SHALL successfully execute preference-related queries (imagePreferenceStatsQuery, preferenceDataQuery, preferenceJobsQuery)
2. WHEN preference data exists in the legacy database THEN the system SHALL transform it into PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS documents
3. WHEN preference queries return valid data THEN the system SHALL create meaningful preference analysis content instead of "data not ready" messages
4. IF preference data is genuinely missing THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful explanation rather than a generic "not ready" message
5. WHEN PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS documents are created THEN they SHALL be available for RAG retrieval and AI responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to diagnose and fix preference data processing issues, so that all users receive complete aptitude analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preference queries fail THEN the system SHALL log specific error details including query names and failure reasons
2. WHEN preference data is missing from the source database THEN the system SHALL identify which specific queries returned empty results
3. WHEN debugging preference issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed query execution results and validation status
4. IF preference queries succeed but document creation fails THEN the system SHALL log transformation errors with context
5. WHEN preference data processing is fixed THEN the system SHALL validate that PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS documents are properly created and stored

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust preference data validation and error handling, so that preference analysis failures don't break the entire ETL pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing preference queries THEN the system SHALL validate each query result against expected schema
2. WHEN preference query validation fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other document types without failure
3. WHEN preference data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL create partial PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS documents with available data
4. IF all preference queries fail THEN the system SHALL create a single informative PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS document explaining the issue
5. WHEN preference documents are created THEN they SHALL pass all document validation checks before storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI chatbot to provide meaningful responses about my preferences even when some preference data is missing, so that I can still get useful insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask about image preferences and data is available THEN the AI SHALL provide detailed preference analysis results
2. WHEN I ask about preference-based career recommendations and data exists THEN the AI SHALL explain how my preferences relate to suggested careers
3. WHEN preference data is partially missing THEN the AI SHALL explain what information is available and what is missing
4. IF preference data is completely unavailable THEN the AI SHALL redirect to other available test results (personality, thinking skills, etc.)
5. WHEN providing preference responses THEN the AI SHALL not fabricate preference data that doesn't exist

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of preference data processing, so that I can proactively identify and resolve preference analysis issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ETL pipeline runs THEN it SHALL track success/failure rates for each preference query type
2. WHEN preference document creation fails THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for administrative review
3. WHEN users report missing preference data THEN administrators SHALL have access to detailed processing logs
4. IF preference data quality degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically flag affected user records
5. WHEN preference processing is restored THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on recovery success rates
