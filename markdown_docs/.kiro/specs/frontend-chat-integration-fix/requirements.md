# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where the frontend chat interface is completely non-functional despite the backend API working correctly. The system shows that Swagger API calls succeed (returning proper responses), but the frontend chat interface fails to send messages or receive responses, making the application unusable for end users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send chat messages through the frontend interface and receive AI responses, so that I can interact with the aptitude analysis chatbot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message in the chat input THEN the system SHALL send the message to the backend API
2. WHEN the backend processes the message THEN the system SHALL display the AI response in the chat interface
3. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the conversation history with both user message and AI response
4. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL include proper user identification in API requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to handle connection issues gracefully, so that I can still communicate even if WebSocket connections fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to HTTP API calls
2. WHEN using HTTP fallback THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as WebSocket connections
3. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status messages to the user
4. WHEN the system recovers from connection issues THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation without data loss

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear debugging information when chat functionality fails, so that I can quickly identify and fix integration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chat messages fail to send THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request payload and response
2. WHEN authentication issues occur THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the authentication state and token validity
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network errors, authentication errors, and server errors
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step execution logs for the entire chat flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to work consistently across different authentication states, so that I can use the system reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is properly authenticated THEN the system SHALL extract the correct user ID for API calls
2. WHEN user authentication expires THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh or redirect to login appropriately
3. WHEN user data is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN the system detects authentication issues THEN the system SHALL prevent message sending until authentication is resolved
